# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
### The python code implements a machine learning algorithm specifically
    multi layer perceptron learning algorithm

The code implements MLP algorithm for only one hidden layer.
The number of nodes in hidden layer equals the number of nodes in input layer + one.
The training file for the code contains features and labels,seperated by '=' and the features are seperated by spaces

The training file looks like :

0 0=0

0 1=1

1 0=1

1 1=0
